Since I started living abroad, low cost carriers - especially Ryanair - have been
incredibly useful to me and I used them frequently. However, in May 2018 I moved
to Paris and I haven't set a foot inside a Ryanair plane since.

My story with Ryanair started in March 2012, when I first visited London to get
a first glimpse of the university that I would be studying at. I quickly became
a rather frequent flyer, first visiting London again while I was still at home,
then once I had moved to London, visiting my family and friends regularly.

Flying Ryanair was mostly a necessity, since they were the only airline that had
direct flights between London and Bremen and those were also the only flights I
could afford as a student. The airport was quite convenient though, being a 45
minute train ride from the city center.

Shortly after I started working in London in 2014, I was lucky enough to travel
to visit clients very regularly and chose British Airways for this, as they have
the largest network from London. I still continued to travel with Ryanair for home
visits though, as they were still the fastest and most conveient connection.

With a move to Barcelona in 2016, I started a new chapter of travelling. I did not
do any business travel anymore, however several low cost carriers have a large base
in Barcelona, so I could afford several weekend trips a month. I was still very
content with the services offered and with the prices they were offered at.

Without Ryanair, my long distance relationship at the time would not have worked
out at all. Being able to visit my partner two countries away for around €100 round
trip is just unbeatable. Every once in a while, I did travel with Lufthansa though,
since they were actually cheaper or more convenient in timing.

During those Lufthansa trips I slowly fell in love with the quality of the service
they offered. I am quite tall and having that little bit extra legroom was pleasant.
There is also still a meal and drinks service on the flight, something that British
Airways has unfortunately done away with; their offer is actually now exactly what
I get with Ryanair or easyjet as well.

The drastic change happened when I moved to Paris in June 2018, a change that I was
completely aware of before I even moved. The "Paris" airport that Ryanair flies to
is almost far enough away from Paris to warrant a flight from there to one of the
real Paris airports.

The journey to this airport is long and expensive and only possible by bus.
When planning a journey, these are factors that have to be taken into account.
I looked into this and weighed my options: With the extra cost for the bus ticket,
the extra time required, the further chance for transport problems and finally,
the comfort of a proper airport, I decided to turn my back on low cost carriers.

While the obvious choice now would be to go with Air France, I actually decided to
continue flying with Lufthansa as my main airline. They don't offer direct flights
to any destinations from Paris, but their connections in Frankfurt and Munich are
planned so well that this is not a problem.

Especially as someone who enjoys travelling and flying itself, rather than just
looking at it as a means to get somewhere, I actually welcome this. While it's not
the best airline product I have seen, Lufthansa is very solid and the cabin crew
is consistenly excellent at their job.

I look back at my time with Ryanair very fondly, as they made travelling possible
for me as a student with no money to spend. For the future, I am very glad that
I can now travel with an airline that has ticket prices that afford it to focus
on the passenger and not on squeezing every cent from them in ancillary sales.
