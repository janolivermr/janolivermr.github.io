In 2017 I was living in Barcelona and was flying with Ryanair very regularly.

In May of this year, I moved to Paris and with this, my Airport situation changed dramatically.
While there are still some low cost carrier flights departing from Charles de Gaulle and Orly,
the majority of those low cost flights are from an airport so far outside of Paris,
it doesn't even deserve the name "Paris" in its name.

The journey to this airport is long and expensive and only possible by bus.
When planning a journey, these are factors that have to be taken into account.
I looked into this and weighed my options. With the extra cost for the bus ticket,
the extra time required, the further chance for transport problems and finally,
the comfort of a proper airport, I decided to turn my back on low cost carriers.

I haven't looked back since. I'm rather tall and enjoy having the extra legroom on the plane.
The airlines serve free food and drinks on board, there are also airline lounges to take advantage off.
Eventually, the cost difference on its own is not even that big anymore.
