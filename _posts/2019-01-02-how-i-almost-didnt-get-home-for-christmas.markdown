December 21st was a normal day like any other for me. I had just finished packing
up all my things for my flight to visit my family over Christmas, readyto leave my
apartment around two hours and 45 minutes before the flight. Ten minutes before
I wanted to leave I received a text message from Lufthansa: "We apologize that your
flight has been cancelled."

At the time I was actually just messaging with my family about my arrival time
and them picking me up at the airport. My original schedule had me going from
Paris to Frankfurt and then after a one hour layover continuing to Bremen.
The first leg was the one that had been cancelled.

I usually don't mind flight delays and cancellations at all, since I plan them with
plenty of time and after all, a delay or cancellation in Europe can give you a
nice compensation and potentially a stay in a hotel. I have experienced this before
with British Airways in 2016. However, this regulation excludes circumstances which
are outside of the control of the airline, like weather for example.

Immediately after receiving the text message, I called the Lufthansa service number
and it only took around 15 seconds to get through to a human. I was apparently so
quick to call, that initially the cancellation hadn't even shown up in the agents
system. Eventually she did confirm that this was most likely weather related.
Beside the fact that that would mean no compensation, I did also want to get to
my destination that evening, because I had quite a few lunch and dinner plans
with different parts of the family.

While talking to the agent, I also looked for alternative routings myself and
managed to find one via Munich instead of Frankfurt. The Lufthansa agent was incredibly
helpful and managed to rebook me on the other flight in around 5 minutes.
The only problem with that flight? It was scheduled to leave 40 minutes before my
initially booked flight.

Without a second to spare, I threw the last few thing into my backpack - luckily
my suitcase was already packed. I left my apartment so quickly indeed, that for
my whole stay I was slightly concerned that I may have left a window open.
I now only had 2 hours to get from my place south of Paris all the way to Paris
Charles de Gaulle airport, check my luggage, go through security, board the plane
and take off.

Through some miracle, there were no issues with the train whatsoever, I arrived
at the terminal after just over an hour. The baggage drop closes 40 minutes before
departure and with skipping the queue, I just about managed to get my suitcase
checked. From there it was actually smooth sailing through security. The only
downside to this arrangement was the extended layover of almost three hours in Munich
and the arrival in Bremen just 5 minutes before the runway closes for the night.

Overall I am quite glad that I booked this flight with Lufthansa. These issues with
a cancelled flight, especially due to bad weather can happen at any time to any
airline. I doubt that many other airlines would have been so quick in arranging
an alternative routing and make the experience so smooth. This was also not the
first time I had to contact Lufthansa by phone for some sort of enquiry and they
have always been able to quickly provide the help I needed. Just imagine I had
booked this flight with Ryanair instead.
